# controlling-robot-movement
in this task I made a website with buttons to control the robot movement like (moving forward/backward - turning right/left). 

{when the user click the forward button the website will send "forward" to the database and esp32 will read it to move forward, and when the user click the right button, we will send "right" to the database and esp32 will also turn right}.
